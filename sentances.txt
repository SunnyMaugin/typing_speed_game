Today I dressed my unicorn in preparation for the race.
She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade.
There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine.
The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be expected.
The body piercing didn't go exactly as he expected.
My biggest joy is roasting almonds while stalking prey.
